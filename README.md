# Portfolio-of-Patrick-Hennessey-Software-Developer

## Description

This project is my portfolio built from scratch using HTML and CSS. It is still a work in progress. Its purpose is to help me find employment as a software developer in the future. It highlights projects I have worked on, my personality, and, to a lesser extent, some of my hobbies and other interests. The portfolio presents my name, a photo of myself, and links to information about me, my projects, and contact information. Some features include a responsive navigation bar, links to my projects and music, my contact information, and links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and Spotify. I learned extensively about HTML formatting and CSS while working on this projectâ€”especially the CSS features of Flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.
